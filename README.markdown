# Fraud Detection Project (Using ML and Deployed using streamlit)

This project implements a machine learning-based fraud detection system for financial transactions. It includes a Jupyter notebook for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and model training, a Streamlit web application for interactive fraud predictions, and a dataset (`AIML Dataset.csv`). The model leverages logistic regression with balanced class weights to address the imbalanced nature of fraud data, achieving high recall for detecting fraudulent transactions.

## Project Overview
The Fraud Detection Project aims to identify fraudulent financial transactions using machine learning. The Jupyter notebook (`notebooks/Analysis_Model.ipynb`) performs EDA, data preprocessing, and trains a logistic regression model to classify transactions as fraudulent or non-fraudulent. The Streamlit app (`src/app.py`) provides a user-friendly interface to input transaction details and receive real-time fraud predictions.

Key features:
- Analysis of transaction data with features like `step`, `type`, `amount`, and `isFraud`.
- Logistic regression model with balanced class weights to handle imbalanced data (0.13% fraud rate).
- Interactive web app for fraud prediction.

## Dataset
The dataset (`data/AIML Dataset.csv`) contains 6,362,620 financial transaction records with the following key columns:
- `step`: Time step of the transaction.
- `type`: Transaction type (e.g., PAYMENT, TRANSFER, CASH_OUT).
- `amount`: Transaction amount.
- `oldbalanceOrg`, `newbalanceOrig`: Origin account balances before and after the transaction.
- `oldbalanceDest`, `newbalanceDest`: Destination account balances before and after the transaction.
- `isFraud`: Binary label (1 for fraudulent, 0 for non-fraudulent).

**Note**: If the dataset exceeds GitHub's 100 MB limit, it is hosted externally. Download it from [Insert External Link, e.g., Google Drive or Kaggle] and place it in the `data/` folder.

## Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/fraud-detection-project.git
   cd fraud-detection-project
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment** (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Prerequisites**:
   - Python 3.8 or higher.
   - If the dataset is hosted externally, download it and place it in `data/AIML Dataset.csv`.

## Usage

### Running the Jupyter Notebook
The notebook contains the full workflow for data analysis, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

1. Navigate to the `notebooks/` folder:
   ```bash
   cd notebooks
   ```

2. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

3. Open `Analysis_Model.ipynb` in the browser and run the cells to:
   - Explore the dataset (EDA).
   - Preprocess data (e.g., encoding `type`, scaling numerical features).
   - Train and evaluate the logistic regression model.
   - Export the model as `fraud_detection_Pipeline.pkl`.

### Running the Streamlit App
The Streamlit app allows users to input transaction details and predict whether a transaction is fraudulent.

1. Navigate to the `src/` folder:
   ```bash
   cd src
   ```

2. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

3. Open the provided URL (e.g., `http://localhost:8501`) in your browser to interact with the app.

### Deployed Streamlit App
The app is deployed on Streamlit Community Cloud. Access it at [Insert Streamlit App URL, e.g., https://your-app-name.streamlit.app]. (Update this section after deployment.)

## Model Details
- **Algorithm**: Logistic Regression with `class_weight='balanced'` to handle the imbalanced dataset (0.13% fraud cases).
- **Features**: `step`, `type` (one-hot encoded), `amount`, `oldbalanceOrg`, `newbalanceOrig`, `oldbalanceDest`, `newbalanceDest`.
- **Preprocessing**:
  - Numerical features scaled using `StandardScaler`.
  - Categorical feature `type` encoded using `OneHotEncoder`.
- **Performance** (on test set):
  - Accuracy: 94.67%
  - Fraud class (isFraud=1):
    - Precision: 0.02 (low due to imbalance)
    - Recall: 0.94 (high, good at detecting fraud)
    - F1-Score: 0.04
  - See `notebooks/Analysis_Model.ipynb` for detailed metrics and confusion matrix.

**Limitations**:
- Low precision for fraud due to class imbalance.
- Future improvements: Use SMOTE for oversampling, test ensemble models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost), or tune hyperparameters.
